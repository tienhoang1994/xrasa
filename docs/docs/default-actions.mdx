title: Default Actions
abstract: Default actions are actions that are built into the dialogue manager by default. Most of these are automatically predicted based on certain conversation situations. You may want to customize these to personalize your assistant.
---

Each of these actions have a default behavior, described in the sections below.
In order to overwrite this default behavior, write a [custom action](./custom-actions.mdx)
whose `name()` method returns the same name as the default action:

  ```python
  class ActionRestart(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_restart"

    async def run(
        self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # custom behavior

        return [...]
  ```

Add this action to the actions section of your domain file so your assistant knows
to use the custom definition instead of the default one:

  ```yaml-rasa
  actions:
    - action_restart
  ```

:::caution
After adding this action to your domain file, re-train your model with
`rasa train --force`. Otherwise Rasa won't know you've changed anything
and may skip re-training your dialogue model.

:::

## action_listen
This action is predicted to signal that the assistant should do nothing and wait
for the next user input.

## action_restart
This action resets the whole conversation history, including any slots that were
set during it.

It can be triggered by the user in a conversation by sending a
"/restart" message, if the [RulePolicy](./rules.mdx) is included in the model configuration.
If you define an `utter_restart` response in your domain, this will be sent to the user as well.

## action_session_start

This action starts a new conversation session, and is executed in the following
situations:
  * at the beginning of each new conversation
  * after a user was inactive for a period defined by the `session_expiration_time` parameter in the domain's
[session configuration](./domain.mdx#session-configuration)
  * when a user sends a "/session_start" message during a conversation

The action will reset the conversation tracker, but by default will not clear any slots that were set.

### Customization

The default behavior of the session start action is to take all existing slots and to
carry them over into the next session. Let's say you do not want to carry over all
slots, but only a user's name and their phone number. To do that, you'd override the
`action_session_start` with a custom action that might look like this:

```python
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet, SessionStarted, ActionExecuted, EventType


class ActionSessionStart(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_session_start"

    @staticmethod
    def fetch_slots(tracker: Tracker) -> List[EventType]:
        """Collect slots that contain the user's name and phone number."""

        slots = []
        for key in ("name", "phone_number"):
            value = tracker.get_slot(key)
            if value is not None:
                slots.append(SlotSet(key=key, value=value))
        return slots

    async def run(
      self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # the session should begin with a `session_started` event
        events = [SessionStarted()]

        # any slots that should be carried over should come after the
        # `session_started` event
        events.extend(self.fetch_slots(tracker))

        # an `action_listen` should be added at the end as a user message follows
        events.append(ActionExecuted("action_listen"))

        return events
```

If you want to access the metadata which was sent with the user message which triggered
the session start, you can access the special slot `session_started_metadata`:

```python
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import SessionStarted, ActionExecuted


class ActionSessionStart(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_session_start"

    async def run(
      self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        metadata = tracker.get_slot("session_started_metadata")

        # Do something with the metadata
        print(metadata)

        # the session should begin with a `session_started` event and an `action_listen`
        # as a user message follows
        return [SessionStarted(), ActionExecuted("action_listen")]
```

## action_default_fallback

This action undoes the last user-bot interaction and sends the `utter_default` response if it is defined.
It is triggered by low action prediction confidence, if you have this [fallback mechanism](./fallback-handoff.mdx) enabled.

## action_deactivate_loop

This action deactivates the active loop and resets the requested slot. This is used when
[handling unhappy paths in forms](./forms.mdx#writing-stories--rules-for-unhappy-form-paths).

:::note
If you wish to reset all slots, we recommend using a custom action
that returns the [`AllSlotsReset`](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/shared/core/events#allslotsreset-objects) event after form deactivation.
:::

## action_revert_fallback_events

:::caution Deprecated!
The `action_revert_fallback_events` action is deprecated since the 2.0 release.
The [`action_two_stage_fallback`](./default-actions.mdx#action_two_stage_fallback) action
now handles all [two-stage fallback behavior](./fallback-handoff.mdx)
:::

## action_two_stage_fallback

This is a fallback loop that can be used to handle low NLU confidence. Read more about
[handling low NLU confidence](./fallback-handoff.mdx#nlu-fallback).

## action_default_ask_affirmation

This action is used by the `action_two_stage_fallback` loop. It asks the user to confirm
the intent of their message. This action can be customized to be more personalized
to your specific use case.

## action_default_ask_rephrase

This action is used by the `action_two_stage_fallback` loop if the user denies the
intent `action_default_ask_affirmation` displays. It asks the user to rephrase
their message.

## action_back

This action undoes the last user-bot interaction. It can be triggered by the user
by sending a "/back" message to the assistant if the [RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) is configured.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
## Form Action

By default Rasa Open Source uses `FormAction` for processing any
[form logic](forms.mdx). You can override this default action with a custom action by
adding a custom action with the form's name to the domain.
Overriding the default action for forms should **only** be used during the process of
migrating from Rasa Open Source 1 to 2. In this case you can override the default
action to instruct Rasa Open Source to use the deprecated `FormAction` which is part of
the Rasa SDK.

## action_unlikely_intent

Rasa Open Source triggers `action_unlikely_intent` via [`UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`](./policies.mdx#unexpected-intent-policy).
You can control how often this action is predicted by tuning the [`tolerance`](./policies.mdx#unexpected-intent-policy)
parameter of `UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`.

### Customization

You can customize your assistant's behaviour to configure what should happen once `action_unlikely_intent`
is triggered. For example, as a follow up you can trigger a hand-off to a human agent with a rule:

```yaml
- rule: trigger human handoff with action_unlikely_intent
  steps:
    - action: action_unlikely_intent
    - action: ask_human_handoff
    - intent: affirm
    - action: trigger_human_handoff
```

Alternatively, you can also override it's behaviour as a [`custom action`](./custom-actions.mdx) by
adding `action_unlikely_intent` to the list of actions in the domain and implementing the custom behaviour:

```python
class ActionUnlikelyIntent(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_unlikely_intent"

    async def run(
        self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # Implement custom logic here
        return []
```

:::note
Since `action_unlikely_intent` can be triggered at any conversation step during inference,
all policies which are trained on only story data, for example - `TEDPolicy`, `UnexpecTEDIntentPolicy`,
`MemoizationPolicy` ignore its presence in the tracker when making a prediction. However, `RulePolicy`
takes its presence into account so that [conversation behaviour is customizable](./default-actions.mdx#customization-1).

:::

:::note
`action_unlikely_intent` cannot be included in the training stories. It can **only** be added to rules.
